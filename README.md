# ðŸ›³ Titanic Survival Prediction - Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview

This project uses the [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data) to predict which passengers were likely to survive the disaster. It walks through the complete machine learning pipeline â€” from data cleaning and exploration to model training, evaluation, and prediction.

Two models were trained and compared:
- **Logistic Regression** (baseline model)
- **Random Forest Classifier** (advanced model)

I also compared model performance against a rule-based prediction (gender-based baseline) to demonstrate the advantage of learning from multiple features.

## Setup Instructions

This project is designed to be run in **Google Colab**, but it will also work in any environment with Python 3 and the required libraries.

---

##  How to Run the Code

1. **Open the Notebook**: Upload or open the `.ipynb` notebook file in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

2. **Upload the Required Files**:
   - first create folder titled `titanic` and place all files below in it
   - `train.csv`
   - `test.csv`
   - *(Optional)* `gender_submission.csv` for baseline comparison

4. **Run All Cells in Order**:
   - Step 1: Load data  
   - Step 2: Explore and understand data  
   - Step 3â€“4: Clean and preprocess data  
   - Step 5â€“7: Train Logistic Regression and Random Forest  
   - Step 8: Evaluate models  
   - Step 9: Make predictions on test set  
   - Bonus Steps: Compare to gender-based baseline & More Visualization (ROC Curve, Feature Importance, Confusion Matrix)

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Results

- **Random Forest Model** achieved the best accuracy (~84%) and outperformed the simple gender-based rule.
- **Important features**: Sex, Passenger Class, Fare, and Age
- **Feature importance** and **confusion matrices** are visualized to support model interpretation.
